# BreakoutGame - Java

## Description

For our second-year assignment we needed to work out a platform that teachers could use to organize quizzes on a bit like Kahoot. The assignment existed out of 2 parts. A desktop application written in Java and a Web application written in C# / ASP.NET MVC CORE 2.0.
In comparison to the first-year assignment we needed to use database frameworks instead of pure SQL (JPA for Java and Entity Framework for .NET).
The Java application was made to create the quizzes while the .NET application would be used by the students to participate in the quizzes.
This repository houses the Java application.

### My role within the team

Because of the good result of our project last year (2 members the same from last team) I was again appointed leader. Because of the deadlines being stricter this time around we also had to be stricter about who did what. So during this project we decided together which features we would complete during each sprint. Each team member decided what he was going to do during the sprint.
My job was mainly writing the main domain code and database communication (persistence layer). I also helped Alexander with some of the GUI code.
