# BreakoutGame - Java

## Description

For our first year assignment we needed to make the game Pazaak. Pazaak is a card game situated in the Star Wars universe.
First we needed to make a console application and later a JavaFX version using the same underlying code.
Below you can also find a video gameplay of our version of the game. At the moment the game uses a local database connection so if you would want to try the game yourself you can send me an email at matthiasdefre@hotmail.com and I will send the database SQL script.

### My role within the team

During the project I was the team leader, we all decided that I would be the one taking that position. Although I was the team leader all team members still had a free choice of what to do, I was there to make sure everything got finished in time and that the quality was good.
I also was the main programmer, this meant that I did most of the main gameplay code and database communication. We also organized weekly sessions to explain the code to each other so everybody knew what each piece of code did.
